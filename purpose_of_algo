Algorithm is a sequence of steps used to solve a problem.
it presents a unique method of addressing an issue by providing a particular solution

Algorithm can be use for any task however trivial such as making a toast
Anytime a sequence of actions achieving some-thing in our life is finite, well-defined and effective, you can view it as an algorithm

Some uses:

  Searching: Locating information or verifying that the information you see the information you want in an essential task

  Sorting: putting information in order is one way to reduce the onrush of data.

  Transforming: Converting one sort of data to another sort of data is critical to understanding and using the data effectively. Eg converting data between two systems

  Scheduling: Making use of resources. Optimizing the utilization of performance and improving system performance

  Graph analysis: Deciding on the shortest path between two points finds all sorts of uses

  Cryptograpghy: Keeping data safe through encryption and decryption and hashing

  Pseudorandom number generation: without the capabilities to generate seeming random numbers, many computer tasks become impossible
